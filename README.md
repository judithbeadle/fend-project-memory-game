## Introduction

A memory game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Based on the classic analogue version.
Two cards are turned over. If they match, they stay open, if not they are turned back face down. 

The aim of the game is to remember the position of icons and match up all pairs in as little moves as possible.

This is a project for the [Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).
